            The Industry Intake Program is a training program for new hires who
            have either graduated from universities or have less than 2 years of
            experience. The program aims to give these talents who are going to
            be hired or who have just joined the company the skills and
            knowledge that they will use in their new role with the new company.
            Our goal is to get these talents ready so that companies can quickly
            put these new hires to work without a lengthy orientation process.
